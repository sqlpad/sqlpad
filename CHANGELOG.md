## [6.0.0] - 2020-11-22

This release removes deprecated functionality and changes some default behaviors, requiring a major version bump. There are some notable enhancements as well however.

### Updating to 6.0.0

Upgrading to version 6 requires existing SQLPad instances be running on a 5.x.x release. If version 4 or earlier is detected, startup and migration will be aborted.

To upgrade, install and run via your preferred method. Version 6 has no data migrations other than a dummy migration to serve as a version marker. If you'd like to roll back to 5.x.x, you _should_ be able to run 5.8.4 on a 6.0.0 database.

Database backups are encouraged however. Please follow good practices if your SQLPad use warrants it.

### Visualization Configuration Sidebar

Visualization configuration has moved into a sidebar on the right. The existing chart button toggles its visibility.

### Multiple Result Sets

Multiple result set support has been added to the UI. When executing multiple SQL statements at once, a summary table will show with the status of each SQL statement. Executing single statements works as it did before.

Note that query visualization is locked to the last SQL statement in a batch.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/303966/99915844-ca5ce180-2ccb-11eb-8277-08f8b33c6eea.png" alt="multiple results running">

### Query Dialog & Sharing Enhancments

Query name, tags, and sharing have been moved to a dialog, appearing on initial save or click on query name in the toolbar. Query sharing has been enhanced, allowing queries to be shared with individual users as well as limit their ability to save changes to the query.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/303966/99915798-6cc89500-2ccb-11eb-9fec-d2b50c5c1fd2.png" width="400" alt="query dialog and sharing enhancements">

### Schema Context Menu

A context menu has been added to the schema sidebar. When right-clicking schemas, tables, and columns, a menu will display with values that can be copied to the clipboard.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/303966/99920524-cb047080-2ce9-11eb-8833-7e60bfe9f7c3.png" width="300" alt="schema context menu">

### User Profile Dialog

Users may now provide a name and change their email as well as password if local authentication is enabled.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/303966/99915807-7e11a180-2ccb-11eb-98ce-0db2a0e61ee7.png" width="400" alt="user profile dialog">

### Strict Configuration Checking

Any environment variables set starting with `SQLPAD_` that are not known by SQLPad will raise an error and prevent SQLPad from starting up. This should help catch config issues early.

### Breaking Changes

- Removes password reset UI emails. Password reset URLs can still be generated in UI via an admin account
- Removes Slack webhook. Use generic webhooks to build your own.
- Removes deprecated configuration variables
- Removes .json and .ini configuration file support
- Removes open admin registration. `SQLPAD_ADMIN` should be used for initial account, or auto sign-up should be enabled when using compatible auth strategy.
- Reduces default query result row limit to 10,000 (previously 50,000)
- Server process exits on configuration error or unknown configuration key

### Maintenance, Fixes, and UX

- Adds query-not-found dialog, prompting user to start new query.
- Simplifies query list (if too much open issue)
- Increases SQL editor font size to 14
- Fixes tag input leaving unselected value in input
- Fixes clone/new URL not changing as expected
- Fixes reusing connection clients on query change (See issue #806)
- Updates dependencies

## [5.2.1] - 2020-07-27

- Fix MySQL2 transaction support
- Fix old query results potentially overwriting new query results when using multi-statement transactions

## [5.2.0] - 2020-07-20

This release introduces new generic webhooks for a variety of events, while deprecating specific communication implementations (SMTP email and Slack). With webhooks, it is up to you to implement communication to your SQLPad users.

The webhooks added support a larger number of events than previously handled, such as queries being run and results/error received from those queries.

  - `LDAP_PASSWORD` ➡ `SQLPAD_LDAP_PASSWORD`
  - `CERT_PATH` ➡ `SQLPAD_HTTPS_CERT_PATH`
  - `CERT_PASSPHRASE` ➡ `SQLPAD_HTTPS_CERT_PASSPHRASE`
  - `KEY_PATH` ➡ `SQLPAD_HTTPS_KEY_PATH`
  - `SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` ➡ `SQLPAD_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET`

## [5.0.0] - 2020-07-03

Version 5 contains many infrastructure and API changes, as well as migrations that are not easy to roll back from. It is highly recommended take a backup of your database (`SQLPAD_DB_PATH` directory and/or your backend db in use).

This release finishes the migration from an embedded JSON database to an ORM and SQLite (used by default). For new instances of SQLPad, the following alternative backend databases may be used: SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL via `SQLPAD_BACKEND_DB_URI`.

Providing a value for `SQLPAD_DB_PATH`/`dbPath` is still required, as the file system is still used for sessions and storage of query results. This requirement will be removed in a later 5.x release.

Migrations will be run on SQLPad start up. To disable this behavior, set `SQLPAD_DB_AUTOMIGRATE` to `false`. Migrations may be run manually via `node server.js --config path/to/file.ext --migrate`. When using `--migrate` the process will exit after applying migrations.

Special thanks to @eladeyal-intel, @bruth, @yorek, @dengc367, @murphyke, and @Wizhi, for all their contributions in this release!

### Enhancements

- Column descriptions added for Google BigQuery

- Added MySQL 2 driver

- Add Redshift driver

- Add ClickHouse driver

- Add ActiveDirectory authentication

- Multi-transaction statement option made available for MySQL/MySQL 2 drivers

- Connection dropdown hidden if user is non-admin and only 1 connection exists

- Connection may be pre-selected via URL query parameter `connectionId` or `connectionName`

- Add default role when using disabling auth (`SQLPAD_DISABLE_AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLE`). `editor` is used by default.

- Users may be enabled/disabled to restrict access (alternative to deletion)

- Migrations may be run on their own using `--migration`

- Automigration may be disabled with `SQLPAD_DB_AUTOMIGRATE`

- Server side filtering and pagination added for `queries` API

- ODBC - limit strategies added for configuring method used to enforce query row limits

- Test connection error shown

- New `/batches` API for running multi-statement SQL. This replaces `/query-result` API, and is written in a more RESTful approach, removing the need to extend SQLPad timeouts. See [API docs](http://getsqlpad.com/#/api-batches) for more info.

- Adds `allowedDomains` config item and deprecates `whitelistedDomains` to be removed in v6.

### Breaking

- Only admins may see all query history

- `denyMultipleStatements` connection option removed. Multiple statements are now attempted to be supported at SQLPad REST API level via `batches` and `statements` API.

- `/download-results/` API has been removed in favor of `/statement-results/`, which is similar but based on `statementId` instead of `cacheKey`. See [API docs](http://getsqlpad.com/#/api-batches) for more info.

- `debug` config option removed. Use `appLogLevel` set to `debug` instead.

- `tableChartLinksRequireAuth` config option removed.

  All table/chart links require authentication going forward. If unauthenticated access to these URLs is necessary, look into whether an alternate auth solution may be used to passively provide authentication as necessary (like auth proxy for example.)

- data model changes:

  - `createdDate` fields have been renamed to `createdAt` (`created_at` in table)
  - `modifiedDate` fields have been renamed to `updatedAt` (`updated_at` in table)
  - `user.signupDate` renamed to `user.signupAt` (`signup_at` in table)
  - `query.modifiedBy` renamed to `query.updatedBy` (`updated_by` in table)
  - `query.createdBy` and `query.updatedBy` now hold user id as opposed to user email address.
  - `query.lastAccessDate` is removed. It was no different from `updatedAt`
  - Connection driver-specific fields have been moved to `connection.data`. Fields are still decorated on base of connection object for compatibility.
  - `cache` table has changed to use `id` instead of `cacheKey`.
  - `cache.expiration` has renamed to `cache.expiryDate` for consistency with other models
  - `cache.queryName` has renamed to `cache.name` for more generic use
  - `cache.schema` has been renamed to `cache.data` and stores raw JSON for generic use

- Regex filter for query history no longer supported

- Config file without an .json or .ini extension will be assumed to be JSON. Specific extensions will be required in a future release.

- Config file that does not exist will throw an error at startup instead of silently ignoring.

## [4.4.0] - 2020-04-22

- Adds ability to set initial default connection via configuration `defaultConnectionId`. (Only for initial load. User connections are then cached locally)
- Changes default query list filter to "all queries" instead of "my queries".
- Defaults schema sidebar to open, and removes local caching of toggle selection.
- Fixes autocomplete missing when schema sidebar is hidden on load.
- Updates dependencies

## [4.3.0] - 2020-04-16

- Support multiple datasets in BigQuery connection
- Fix sql splitting for strings containing `;`

## [4.2.0] - 2020-04-06

### Features

- Add Google BigQuery support [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/connections?id=bigquery)

- Add SQLite support [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/connections?id=sqlite)

- Adds batch query support to ODBC (last statement is shown in UI)

- Auth: Add option to disable authentication. [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/authentication?id=no-authentication)

  When auth is disabled, application no longer requires authentication.

- Auth: Add proxy authentication support. [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/authentication?id=auth-proxy)

- Add private/shared query model.

  Going forward queries are _private_ by default. When sharing is enabled, query is shared with all users (and they are given write permissions). Finer-grained access to be added in the future (share with specific user, read vs write)

- Add connection and query seed data support [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/seed-data)

- Add service tokens (api tokens). New menu option is available when logged in as admin.

- Add application header for application-level administration

- Adds multi-statement transaction support for Postgres, SQLite, and ODBC. [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/connections?id=multi-statement-transaction-support)

- Add config deprecation for following keys: `debug`, `tableChartLinksRequireAuth`, `keyPath`, `certPath`, `certPassphrase`

- Add connection template support [documentation](https://getsqlpad.com/#/connection-templates)

- Adds additional query run logging for queries executed and details surrounding them (logged under `info` level)

### Fixes

- Fix: long connection form display to always show save/test buttons

- Use ISO 8601 timestamps for log messages instead of unix epoch

### Maintenance / Misc / Dev updates

- Updated dependencies
- Introduced SQLite as backing store. nedb data (embedded db currently in use) will eventually be migrated to SQLite.
- Added migration framework. Migrations are run at server startup.
- Added mult-stage build
- Lots of refactoring to better organize authentication, addition of new features.

## [4.1.1] - 2020-03-10

- Fix auth for email addresses containing `+` and quoted `@` characters

## [4.1.0] - 2020-02-25

### Features

- Add Snowflake driver/support (#519)
- Add MS SQL Server readOnly intent option (#520)
- Add logging using pino (#527, #547)

  SQLPad now logs json messages to stdout using the [pino](http://getpino.io/#/) library. Amount of logging can be controlled by setting `appLogLevel` and `webLogLevel` for application and web logs respectively. Pino does not manage log transport, but has an ecosystem of tooling available that does http://getpino.io/#/docs/transports.

- Allow dynamic user data in connection configuration (#544)

  Connections can have user values dynamically substituted in connection configuration values containing text values. This is a work-in-progress and can be used for adventurous. See PR for details, otherwise more info and corresponding UI will come with future releases.

- Add GitHub Release builds via build pipeline (#550)
- Add `dbInMemory` setting (#553)

  `dbInMemory` will run the embedded SQLPad db in memory without logging to disk. Enabling this does not remove the need for `dbPath` at this time, as file system access is still required for result caches and express session support. (`dbPath` to become optional in future release)

### Fixes

- Fix TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt (#522)
- Fix tests for non-utc time zones (#524)

### Maintenance

- Update server dependencies (#525)
- Maintenance & refactoring (#534, #535, #538, #539, #540, #541, #542, #543, #545, #551, #552, #553)

## [3.0.2] - 2019-09-01

- Removes npm version update check and related config item `disableUpdateCheck`

## [3.0.1] - 2019-09-01

SQLPad v3 is a UI redesign/refresh along with a large file structure change and configuration change. It has been in "beta" for quite some time, and if you are running the latest docker image or running a recent build of master, you've already been using it.

### Features

- URLs in query results will be turned into links
- SAML authentication support
- Remember selected connection id / schema toggle
- Configurable session time and secret
- Support for JSON and INI config file added. File should config using `key` fields found in [configItems.js](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/blob/master/server/lib/config/config-items.js). Config file path default is `$HOME/.sqlpadrc` and may otherwise be specified using `--config` via command line or `SQLPAD_CONFIG` environment variable.

### Breaking changes

- CLI flags have been changed to use config item key (#460)
- Default db path is no longer used if db path is not provided in config. Previous default was `$HOME/sqlpad/db`.
- Default config file path no longer used. Previous default was `$HOME/.sqlpadrc`.
- Configuration UI has been removed. See https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/issues/447.
- cli-flags in saved .sqlpadrc JSON are no longer used for config values. These configuration keys should instead be switched the the `key` found in `configItems.js`. For example, instead of `dir` or `db`, use `dbPath`. Instead of `cert-passphrase` use `certPassphrase`, etc.
- `--save` and `--forget` cli flags no longer supported

### Fixes

- Fix preview sticking around after query selection
- Fix tag/search input in query list
- Add loading indicator for schema sidebar
- Fix user needing to sign in again after sign up
- Fix app menu for non-admin users
- Fix frozen editor after query error

## [3.0.0] - 2019-09-01

This build is broken. sorry :(

## [3.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-06-25

Beta for version 3 may be installed via latest docker image, or by installing via npm referencing exact version or beta tag.

SQLPad v3 is backwards-compatible with SQLPad v2 database files, and is mostly a UI redesign/refresh and a large file structure change. Give it a try and if you aren't ready for it roll back to v2 and everything should still work.

#### Editor-first UI refresh

UI components previously based on bootstrap UI components are now replaced by custom components. Magenta is embraced as a secondary color.

Management and listing pages (Queries, connections, users, and configuration) have been moved into side drawers, allowing management and browsing of things without leaving the current query. The query editor is the primary focus of the application.

Query editor toolbars have been consolidated into a single bar to maximize use of space on the page.

Unsaved changes to a previously-saved query are now saved, prompting the user to restore on next open. This is not enabled for unsaved changes to "new" queries since it could become an annoyance, but can be added if there is interest.

Query result chart has been moved to a smaller resizable pane along side the SQL query instead of being placed in a tab. This impacts the size available for the chart, but brings it to the default view, allowing altering of the query without changing tabs.

The schema sidebar may now be hidden and is now searchable. It has also been rewritten to render large trees efficiently.

Query result grid no longer has data bars for numeric values since it didn't make sense for all number values. Date value display logic has been altered to only show timestamps if timestamps are detected. When timestamps are shown, the full timestamp from the JavaScript date object is displayed.
