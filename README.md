## Docker Image

The docker image runs on port 3000 and uses `/var/lib/sqlpad` for the embedded database directory.

`latest` tag is continuously built from latest commit in repo. Only use that if you want to live on the edge, otherwise use specific version tags to ensure stability.

See [docker-examples](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/tree/master/docker-examples) directory for example docker-compose setup with SQL Server.
