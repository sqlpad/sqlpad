## Project Status

SQLPad is a legacy project in maintenance mode. If evaluating SQLPad, please consider a [potential alternative](https://getsqlpad.com/en/introduction/#alternatives) or forking the project and making it your own.

Maintenance releases for security and dependency updates will continue as possible.

## Docker Image

The docker image runs on port 3000 and uses `/var/lib/sqlpad` for the embedded database directory.

`latest` tag is continuously built from latest commit in repo. Only use that if you want to live on the edge, otherwise use specific version tags to ensure stability.

See [docker-examples](https://github.com/sqlpad/sqlpad/tree/master/docker-examples) directory for example docker-compose setup with SQL Server.
